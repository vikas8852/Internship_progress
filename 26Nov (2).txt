 * What is an API ?
API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of protocols, routines, and tools that
allow software applications to communicate with each other. It defines the methods a
data formats that programs use to request and exchange information.
It acts as a bridge between systems, enabling them to share data or functionality without exposing their internal details.

Key Concepts of an API:-
1.Interface:
APIs define the methods and data formats that applications can use to communicate. For example, an API may allow you to fetch user information by calling a specific function or URL.

2.Abstraction:
APIs hide the complexity of a system's implementation, providing simple ways to interact with it. For instance, you don't need to know how a database is structured to fetch data via an API.





 What is REST API?
A REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a way for systems to communicate over the internet using 
standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. It's a popular architecture for building web services due to its simplicity, scalability, 
and compatibility with many programming languages.
